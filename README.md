# Fake-Food-Review-Detector
Our project solves the problem of fake or promotional restaurant reviews that often mislead customers. Many reviews online are not written by real diners but by marketing campaigns or bots, making it hard for people to trust them. To address this, we built a simple system that automatically analyzes and flags suspicious reviews.
